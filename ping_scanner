#Clarifications: 
#ICPM protocol: message protocol that allows to know if a determinate machine is available or not disponible o no (message exchange)
#					The "ping" command use the ICPM "ECHO_REQUEST" message to know, if the machine is available.
#					If it is active, it will send ICPM "ECHO_REPLY" message, showing its state  
#					There are 20 types of ICMP message.
#   Traceroute: this tool is used to make an analysis of the traffic of the packages from the different routers and we can see
                where the packages go.
#	Popen: this builder allows the arguments be prepared for the new programm, allowing the father proccess to comunicate with it 	
#		     through the pipes. We will use PIPE for that.
